# Developer Workflow

During your time as a developer both in this class and beyond, you're going to deal with your code not working correctly. This is totally fine! This happens to everyone from bootcamp students to CTO's with 30+ years of experience. One of the key things to learn is how to handle fixing those problems as they arrive. Developers need to be process oriented when finding out how to fix their bugs in their code. We've put together a guide on how to approach that process

## Encountering Bugs During Lab

1. *Encountering a Bug* - you try to make your code do something, but it doesn't do what you expect
1. *Attempt to Debug Your Code* - many times when your code isn't working you will get an error message. Read what the error is saying - though it might look scary, often times the error message tells you exactly what you need to do to fix it. If not, Google the error message and find some possible solutions online (Stackoverflow often is great!) and try them out.
1. *Ask a Peer* - If you still can't figure it out, this is a great time to ask a peer. Why a peer? Most times, your peer will be going through the exact same problem as you are. We'll explain concepts as people who have been coding for a while but your peer will probably explain it better in terms for a beginner. *BUT* we are still the instructors and students are still students: if a peer is busy or you are nervous asking for help, feel free to ask one of us
1. *Ask an Instructor* - Pretty self explanatory, right? Either raise your hand or slack one of us and we'll come over if we're not busy to help. Keep in mind, if you ask us to help you we will ask "What have you tried so far?". Not only does this let us know what you've already tried so we don't have to try the same thing over again but this also helps you to develop your skill in "speaking code" to another person

*Benefits*
- Helps you to develop your problem solving skills as a developer
- This is the process that developers use when asking for help in the field
- Often times, students end up figuring out how to fix their problem when using this process
- If options are eliminated and you explain the problem to us, we can help you faster
