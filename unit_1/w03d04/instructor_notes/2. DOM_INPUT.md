# DOM Input

### LESSON OBJECTIVES
_after this lesson, students will be able to:_

1. Capture text input from the browser
1. Use a form's submit event
1. Build a list from input

## Capture text input from the browser

Let's provide a means for the user to provide input, and capture that input with an event handler.

You should have an input field and a button in your `index.html`

```javascript
<input type="text" id="input-box" />
<input type="submit" id="submit-btn" />
```

As a sanity check, let's setup a basic event on the submit button

```javascript
$('#submit-btn').on('click', () => {
  console.log('clicked'); // 'clicked' appears when the submit button is clicked
});
```

Make it so the handler grabs the value inside the input box (and logs it)

Use jQuery `.val()`

```javascript
$('#input-box').val()
```

```javascript
$('#submit-btn').on('click', () => {
  const inputValue = $('#input-box').val(); // we grab the value from the input box 
  console.log(inputValue); // we log the value to make sure that it works
});
```

## Use a form's submit event

With a **form** tag you can hit the enter key to submit the form data. This is also best practice. HTML5 was updated with web accessibility in mind. Making a form a true form is best practice.

```javascript
<form>
    <input type="text" placeholder="enter your name" id="input-box"/>
    <input type="submit">SUBMIT</button>
</form>
```

Set the handler on the form element instead of the submit. Also, change the event from a click to a submit. An additional benefit is that you can now submit the form by clicking on the submit button OR pressing the enter key.

```javascript
$('form').on('submit', () => {
  const inputValue = $('#input-box').val(); // we grab the value from the input box 
  console.log(inputValue); // we log the value to make sure that it works
});
```

### Prevent default refresh

When you submit the form, the default action is to refresh the page. Let's prevent this default behavior with the aptly named `preventDefault`.

```javascript
$('form').on('submit', (event) => {
  event.preventDefault() // stops the page from being refreshed
  
  const inputValue = $('#input-box').val(); // we grab the value from the input box 
  console.log(inputValue); // we log the value to make sure that it works
});
```

### Reset your input field

`.trigger()` can trigger events on elements (click, hover, etc).  The `reset` event clears a text input

```javascript
$(ELEMENT).trigger('reset');
```

```javascript
$('form').on('submit', (event) => {
  event.preventDefault() // stops the page from being refreshed
  
  const inputValue = $('#input-box').val(); // we grab the value from the input box 
  console.log(inputValue); // we log the value to make sure that it works

  $(event.currentTarget).trigger('reset') // resets the current target(the form) to how it originally was (blank text fields)
});
```

## Build a list from input

Make a Gratitude list to store things you are grateful for. 
<!-- Let's thing big picture of what we need to accomplish to get this done. -->

<!-- * Make a `list` array where your gratitude data will be stored
* Push input into the list
* Run a function **render** that will render items in the list.

1. Grab an item from the input
1.  -->

### Steps

1. Let's add a `ul` so that we can add in `li` elements for each todo item

```html
<ul></ul>
```

1. We know that each of our items will need to be `<li>`'s inside of our `<ul>`. So let's grab our new create a new `<li>` and add it to our `<ul>` to see if it works

```javascript
$('form').on('submit', (event) => {
  event.preventDefault() // stops the page from being refreshed
  
  const inputValue = $('#input-box').val(); // we grab the value from the input box 
  console.log(inputValue); // we log the value to make sure that it works

  const listItem = $('<li>') // creates a blank list item
  $('ul').append(listItem) // grabs blank ul that we wrote in our HTML and adds the blank li that we created with jQuery

  $(event.currentTarget).trigger('reset') // resets the current target(the form) to how it originally was (blank text fields)
});
```

1. Now our list items aren't supposed to be blank - they're supposed to have the input value that we've grabbed from the input box. We can use the `.text()` method to add those values.

```javascript
$('form').on('submit', (event) => {
  event.preventDefault() // stops the page from being refreshed
  
  const inputValue = $('#input-box').val(); // we grab the value from the input box 
  console.log(inputValue); // we log the value to make sure that it works

  const listItem = $('<li>') // creates a blank list item
  listItem.text(inputValue) // puts our inputValue inside of our newly created list item

  $('ul').append(listItem) // grabs blank ul that we wrote in our HTML and adds the now populated list item

  $(event.currentTarget).trigger('reset') // resets the current target(the form) to how it originally was (blank text fields)
});
```

Great! Now we have a working list where we can add items dynamically
<!-- 
* Make **render** function to iterate over all items in the list

```javascript
const render = () => {
  console.log('list: ', list);
  list.forEach((item) => {

    console.log(item);

  });
}
``` -->


<!-- * Make a list item for every item in the array

```javascript
const render = () => {
  $('ul').empty();
  list.forEach((item) => {    
    $('ul').append('<li>' + item + '</li>');
  });
}
``` -->

## Targeting Dynamically Added Elements

Now we want to cross out things we've already taken time to be grateful for when we click on them. How could we set that up?

1. Let's target the item that we would need to click on. Can we reuse the event handler that we were using before 🧐? We actually can't. That one is specifically for a form that is being submitted. Now we want to have an event to be handled when a list item is being clicked on. Let's write this new handler and start it off as we always should with a sanity check so we know it's working

```javascript
$('li').on('click', () => {
  console.log('clicked!')
});
```

1. Wait a second? It's not working! Why is that? One quirk about jQuery is that it can't target items that have been added after the page has first loaded - these items are generally referred to as *dynamically added content*. Luckily, we can tweak the syntax of our event handler so that jQuery can see our dynamically added content. The new syntax is something like this.

```js
$('body').on(EVENT, TARGET, () => {
  // some code
})
```

What this is saying, is that we want jQuery to look at the entire `body` of our page and fire any time the event (in our case `'click'`) happens to our target (in our case `li`)

In our example, we will have this:

```javascript
$('body').on('click', 'li', () => {
  console.log('clicked!') // logs 'clicked'
});
```
Now `'click'` is appearing the way that we expect!

1. Let's make sure that we can target the specific `<li>` that we want. For that, let's pass in that event object and use `currentTarget`

```javascript
$('body').on('click', 'li', (event) => {
  console.log(event.currentTarget) // logs the current <li> being clicked
});
```

1. Now all we have to do is change the functionality from logging to putting a line through. For that we can use our jQuery `.css()` method to put a line through our items. Don't forget! `event.currentTarget` gets us a regular DOM object, if we want use a jQuery method we need to 'wrap it in money' first

```javascript
$('body').on('click', 'li', (event) => {
  console.log(event.currentTarget) // logs the current <li> being clicked
  console.log($(event.currentTarget)) // if you like, you can log the 'money' version so that you can see the difference
  $(event.currentTarget).css('text-decoration', 'line-through')
});
```

That's it! Now we have a fully functional list where we can interact with dynamically added items
<!-- 

Make sure you add it in the `render()` function.  If you do it outside of `render()` there won't be any `li`'s to attach the listener to

You'll notice that adding new items removes the line-throughs of the old items.  We can fix this by simply appending the last item instead of rendering the entire list each time:

```javascript
const render = ()=>{
    $('ul').append("<li>" + list[list.length-1] + "</li>");
    $('li').on('click', (event)=>{
        $(event.currentTarget).css('text-decoration', 'line-through');
    })
}
``` -->

## BONUS: Try jQuery UI

Main site: https://code.jquery.com/ui/

```javascript
$('li').on('click', (event)=>{
  $(event.currentTarget).css('text-decoration', 'line-through');
  $(event.currentTarget).effect('shake');
})
```
