# EVENT TARGETING

## Lesson Objectives



1. Access the event parameter
1. Use `event.currentTarget` to target the specific element being targetted
1. Bonus: pratice breaking a larger problem down into smaller steps



## Getting started

- Go into the `event_targeting` folder in `student_examples` and open the files in your text editor. Then open your index.html in the browser

## Targeting our Target

- Let's target all of our cards when click on them

```js
$(() => {
  $('.card').on('click', () => {
    console.log('clicked')
  })
})
```

- Let's get the card to 'flip over' by clicking on it. To do that we'll just toggle the 'card-back' class

```js
$(() => {
  $('.card').on('click', () => {
    $('.card').toggleClass('card-back')
  })
})
```

Now when we click, we get all the cards to turn over.

What we need to do is target the very card we are clicking on. We can do this by accessing the event parameter

```js
$(() => {
  $('.card').on('click', (event) => {
    console.log(event)
    $('.card').toggleClass('card-back')
  })
})
```

Looks something like this:

We can go deeper and access the `event.currentTarget`

And, in this case, we see we clicked on the first card

Now what we want to do now, is to toggle that `card-back` class as we did earlier. But! The problem is that the `.toggleClass` method that we used earlier is only available to a jQuery object, and the object that we've gotten from `event.currentTarget` is a vanilla Javascript DOM object. What are we supposed to do??

Luckily, we can covert it into a jQuery object by 'wrapping it in money'. All you need to do is wrap the `event.currentTarget` object in our useful `$()`

```js
    console.log($(event.currentTarget))
```

Great! Let's see if we can just toggle the class of this current target

```js
$(()=> {
  $('.card').on('click', (event)=>{
    console.log($(event.currentTarget))
    $(event.currentTarget).toggleClass('card-back')
  })
})
```


That's it! Now we can target each card and 'flip' it
