## Technical Requirements

Minimum Functionality Required for this homework to be considered complete:

1. A game that loads by opening an html file in the browser, the game works through the Chrome console with console.log messages
1. A working game that loads without any syntax errors on start
1. You have a battleship that can attack an alien ship at least one time
   - Be sure to display this info in the console
   - Remember, all ships should have: hitpoints(hull), damage points(firepower)
1. You have _at least_ one alien ship that has hitpoints and damage points that can attack your ship at least one time
   - Again, be sure to display this info in the console
1. The two ships battle until one is destroyed (i.e. has a hull <= 0) and a win/lose message is displayed
1. Refer to the original [markdown](../instructor_notes/space_battle.md) for more details
