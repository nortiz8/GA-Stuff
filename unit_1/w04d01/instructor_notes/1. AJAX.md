## Intro To APIs

**What is an API?**

> Basically, an API is a service that provides raw data for public use.

API stands for "Application Program Interface" and technically applies to all of software design. Since the explosion of the internet, the term now commonly refers to accessing for raw data.

APIs publish data for public use. As third-party software developers, we can access an organization's API and use their data within our own applications.

  <summary><strong>Q: Why do we care?</strong></summary>

> Why recreate data when we don't have to? Think about past projects or ideas that would be easier if you could pull in data already gathered elsewhere.

> APIs can provide us with data that would we would otherwise not be able to create ourselves.

</details>

As we move into building single page applications, now is the perfect time to start understanding how to obtain data on the client side and then render it on the browser.

### API Keys

Many APIs are restricted. Maintaining data on a server can get expensive and the data on a lot of these sites is valuable.

The two main ways individuals/companies can get access to APIs is through API keys - a special set of characters that is purchased through the website. Every time you make a request, the key must be used, this lets the API keep track of how many requests you make and limit/charge you accordingly.

For today we'll get our own key from OMDB - it will be free, because we are using it for educational purposes.
<!-- 
The other way is OAuth. OAuth is a tangent to what we'll talk about today, but if you want to learn more, here is a [good start](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4201431/what-exactly-is-oauth-open-authorization). -->

Typically, API keys go in as query parameters. Query parameters go at the end of a URL. They start with a `?` and then have key value pairs. Many key-value pairs can be used and each key-value pair can be used by separating them with an ampersand.

How do we get data for our own sites?
<!-- 
#### Data over the Internet

the `http` transfer protocol, in essence, just sends strings to be parsed and interpreted. There are certain standards and patterns beyond what we will cover today.

When the internet first kicked off, files were sent over whole. A newer technology evolved, which allowed only certain parts of a web page to be updated.

For example, many web sites have a google map embedded in their site. You can interact with the map (zoom in, move it around), and the map will update without causing the whole page to reload. This technology to only reload a portion of a webpage is often referred to as AJAX. -->

#### AJAX Request

AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML

You don't need to worry too much about what XML is. It was once a popular way to store and send data over the internet but it's rarely used today. JSON has become the predominant way to send data over the internet.

Even though JSON has become the preferred method of data transfer, no one seems in a hurry to start calling AJAX AJAJ.

#### JSON

JSON stands for **J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation. It is a lightweight way for storing and transporting data.

JSON is just a long string of characters. It is based off the JavaScript Object syntax. One notable difference is that double quotes must always be used for keys and values.

When we will use AJAX, we will be sending and receiving JSON.

AJAX allows us to only reload portions of a web page. Another example might be a stock ticker on a news website.

#### AJAX & jQuery

jQuery was the first to make AJAX requests a breeze. To use AJAX, you just call the `$.ajax()` function


#### Let's Summarize

Modern websites render some data on the page. Websites get data to render using an **API**. Some APIs are not publically available, so if you want to use them ou need an **API key** to access the data. You get access to an APIs data using an **AJAX Request** and we get back data as **JSON**

#### Mini Movie App

You are making a web page for Gerard Von Schtieffel's MüvieHaüs. This arthouse movie theater is going to play a wide range of movies. Rather than look up and enter all the data for every movie that will be played, we'll just look up the title and get the rest of the data from OMDB (Open Movie Data Base).

#### Getting Started

We'll have our page get data from the external site http://www.omdbapi.com/.

Choose Free, under `use` put school project or something similar

### Our Endpoint

**app.js**

```javascript
$(() => {
  const titleQuery = 'eraserhead'
  const endpoint = `http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE&t=${titleQuery}`

  console.log(endpoint)
})
```

Open up our index.html in our browser, we should have a clickable link in our dev tools console. When we click the link we should see our movie details

Great! Now we want to populate this data in our web page

Our AJAX function takes one argument, an object. We'll set one key value pair for our url of where to get our data

```js

const data = $.ajax({
  url: endpoint
})

console.log(data)

```

We can scroll down and in `responseJSON` we see our data let's console log it!

```js
console.log(data.responseJSON)
```

Uh oh! It's undefined!

### JavaScript Promises

Remember JavaScript is Asynchronous, so our AJAX call isn't finished getting the all the data before our console.log fires.

jQuery's AJAX method actually returns a `promise`. A `promise` is a special JavaScript object that can wait for a response and `then` do something

```js
$.ajax({
  url: endpoint
}).then((data) => {
  console.log(data) // get data asynchronously, when the data gets back, handle it
})
```

This can be messy so instead of passing an anon function, lets pass it a named function that will handle all of our data and give it the name `handleData`

```js
const handleData = (data) => {
  console.log(data)
}

$.ajax({
  url: endpoint
}).then(handleData) // get data asynchronously, when the data gets back, handle it
```


### Add our Data to the DOM

Let's start by adding the title. By looking at the `data` object in the console, you see that the title would be at `data.Title`. Let's put that in an `<h1>` and add our `<h1>` to our page

```js
$(()=> {
const handleData = (data) => {
  console.log(data.Title)

  const $title = $('<h1>').text(data.Title) // create h1 and put the title inside
  $('.container').append($title) // add the title to the container

  const $director = $('<h2>').text(`Directed by the one and only ${data.Director}`) // create the h2 and put the director inside
  $('.container').append($director) // add the director to the container
  
}

$.ajax({ url: endpoint }).then(handleData) // get data asynchronously, when the data gets back, handle it
```

We can do something similar with the director.

```js
const handleData = (data) => {

  const $title = $('<h1>').text(data.Title) // create h1 and put the title inside
  $('.container').append($title) // add the title to the container

  const $director = $('<h2>').text(`Directed by the one and only ${data.Director}`) // create the h2 and put the director inside
  $('.container').append($director) // add the director to the container
  
}

$.ajax({ url: endpoint }).then(handleData) // get data asynchronously, when the data gets back, handle it

```
<!-- 
We can even add the image

```js
const getMovie = () => {
  $.ajax({
    url: queryURL + titleQuery
  }).then((movieData) => {
    $('.container').html(`
      <h2> ${movieData.Title} </h2>
      <h3> ${movieData.Year} </h3>
      <h4> ${movieData.Rated} <h4>
      <h5> ${movieData.Genre} <h5>
      <p>  ${movieData.Plot} </p>
      `)
      const $img = $('<img>').attr('src', movieData.Poster).attr('alt', movieData.Title)
      $('.container').append($img)
  }, (error) => {
    console.error(error)
  })
}

$(()=> {
  getMovie()
})

``` -->

### Make our Request Dynamic

Right now the only thing that our app can do is search for "eraserhead" but that's not very dynamic. It would be more useful if we can search different movies and grab information from them. Let's modify our app so that we can search movies through the input box.

First, let's grab the title that we type from our input fild

**app.js**

```js
$('form').on('submit', (event) => {
  event.preventDefault() // stop page from reloading

  const titleQuery = $('.title-query').val() // get value from input
})
```

There's on problem, though. The way that we currently get our query won't grab our new dynamic value from the input field. Let's comment out the hardcoded version of our titleQuery and replace it with our new dynamic version

```js
$('form').on('submit', (event) => {
    event.preventDefault() // stop page from reloading

    const titleQuery = $('.title-query').val() // get value from input
    const endpoint = `http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=ae2e7a36&t=${titleQuery}` // create endpoint based on query

    $.ajax({ url: endpoint }).then(handleData) // get data asynchronously, when the data gets back, handle it
  })
```


Whole Code:

```js
$(() => {
  const handleData = (data) => {

    const $title = $('<h1>').text(data.Title) // create h1 and put the title inside
    $('.container').append($title) // add the title to the container

    const $director = $('<h2>').text(`Directed by the one and only ${data.Director}`) // create the h2 and put the director inside
    $('.container').append($director) // add the director to the container
  }


  $('form').on('submit', (event) => {
    event.preventDefault() // stop page from reloading

    const titleQuery = $('.title-query').val() // get value from input
    const endpoint = `http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=ae2e7a36&t=${titleQuery}` // create endpoint based on query

    $.ajax({ url: endpoint }).then(handleData) // get data asynchronously, when the data gets back, handle it
  })

})
```
