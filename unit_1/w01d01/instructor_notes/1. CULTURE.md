## Communication Tools

### Slack

#### 4 channels

- sei-skynet-students
    - main classroom notes and prompts
- sei-skynet-partytime
    - morale boosting, bonding, comic relief
- sei-skynet-outcomes
    - all things outcomes
- sei-skynet-parkinglot
    - technical questions and tangental topics to class

#### How To:

##### Communicate in one of the slack channels:

	- @username
		- sends a notification to a specific user
	- @channel / @here
		- sends a notification to everyone / everyone currently online
    - DO NOT use these unless absolutely necessary (usually only instructors/ta's use this)

You can format your text in slack. Once you begin typing, below the input box a few options will appear

![](https://i.imgur.com/Vs1ifZe.png)

- use `*` to make something bold
- use `_` to make something italic
- use `~` to strike through text
- use one pair of backticks to make one line or less of code formatted (will appear pink)
- use three sets of back ticks for multiple lines of code
- use the `+` to add a snippet of code
- use `>` to quote someone

##### Communicate privately:

- Direct messages are one-on-one messages nobody else can see.
- In addition, you can make group direct messages to talk to multiple people at once, privately.

##### Other:

	- You can mute channels that you no longer need (Fundamentals)
	- You can adjust the sound / notifications of your messages

### After hours:
 - The instructional team is unavailable after hours
 - You may be on your own but you are never alone - reach out to your classmates through slack and zoom, or other tools to work on things together
 - If you have an emergency let [student services](studentservicessmd@ga.co) and us know. But we won't be following up until we have clocked in the next class day.

### Zoom

Our video conferencing tool!

- Occasional use - i.e. checking in if campus is closed due to a snowstorm.
