## MERN Delete


Let's add a new table cell

**App.js**
```js
<tbody>
  { this.state.holidays.map(holiday => {
      return (
        <tr key={holiday._id} >
          <td> {holiday.name }</td>
          <td>X</td>
        </tr>
      )
    })
  }
</tbody>
```

Let's add a function called delete holiday. It will do two things, make a call to our api to delete the holiday and **then** update our view to reflect our data

```js
async deleteHoliday(id) {
  await axios.delete(`${baseURL}/holidays/${id}`)
  const filteredHolidays = this.state.holidays.filter((holiday) => {
    return holiday._id !== id
  })

  this.setState({
    holidays: filteredHolidays
  })
}
```

Bind it in our constructor

```js
this.deleteHoliday = this.deleteHoliday.bind(this)
```

Now we'll add a click event to our new `td`

**gotcha** in order to pass an argument in our click event we have to wrap our function inside an anonymous function


```js
<td onClick={()=>this.deleteHoliday(holiday._id)}>X</td>
```
