# MERN Simple Update

We can alter the way our app looks (change CSS) based on our data.

We'll gray out our holidays based on whether or not we have celebrated them (a boolean, defaulted to `false`)

Let's write a toggle function that will update the celebrated value of the holiday that is double clicked on in the database

```js
async toggleCelebrated(selectedHoliday) {
    await axios.put(`${baseURL}/holidays/${selectedHoliday._id}`, { celebrated: !selectedHoliday.celebrated })
```

To see if this worked correctly, we can refresh the page.

Now we need to update it in the state so that our server and client will remain in sync.

We need to update the array of holidays to be a new array of holidays with the selected holiday having an updated celebrated value. To do that we can use `.map`

```js
async toggleCelebrated(selectedHoliday) {
  await axios.put(`${baseURL}/holidays/${selectedHoliday._id}`, { celebrated: !selectedHoliday.celebrated })

  const updatedHolidays = this.state.holidays.map((holiday) => {
    if (holiday._id === selectedHoliday._id) {
      holiday.celebrated = !holiday.celebrated
      return holiday
    } else {
      return holiday
    }
  })
  
  this.setState({
    holidays: updatedHolidays
  })
}
```

And bind it in the constructor

```js
  this.toggleCelebrated = this.toggleCelebrated.bind(this)
```

Add an event listener to the holiday name and toggle the css of the name. Again because we need to pass an argument we have to wrap our function in an anonymous function for our event handler

```js
<td
  onDoubleClick={() => this.toggleCelebrated(holiday)}
  className={holiday.celebrated ? 'celebrated' : null}
>{holiday.name} Day</td>
```

Think, why would we want to use a ternary in this situation instead of short circuiting üßê?

## Your turn

### Everyone

Create the functionality to increase the number of likes by clicking an image of balloons

Add two new `td`s
- one that has the total number of likes
- one that has an image of a balloon

```js
<td>{holiday.likes}</td>
<td><img src={ballons} alt="ballons"/></td>
```
### Bonus

![](https://i.imgur.com/ytiCTRS.png)

Create the functionality to update all the fields with a form that pops up as a modal:

- make sure that the form is pre-populated with values

```js
 <td><img src={pencil} alt="pencil" onClick={this.toggleUpdateForm}/></td>
```
