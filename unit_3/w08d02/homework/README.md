You friend, an incredible chef ðŸ˜‹, asked you to create a single page application to display the information about how to cook his famous Chicken Tikka Masala... 

#### First things first:
You are given a [recipes](./recipes) React application. Your task is to **inspect** `index.html` thoroughly and break it down into components.  

Additionally, in the application file structure you are given a `data` folder that contains a json object with all the data you need to render on the page.
How might you use it? Maybe you need to `import` and store it somewhere?... maybe?... where? ... how?

## Suggested ways to start:
* What do you need to run when presented with an application containing `package.json` with dependencies? Install dependencies? ... maybe?
* Run `npm start` and navigate to the `localhost:3000` to see what's what ðŸ¤“
* Inspect `index.html` thoroughly and think of what and how many components might you have? 
* Whiteboard and **color code** all the components you come up with...
* Do you need `state`? If yes, where would it live? Where would you pass props?
* Inspect  `App.css` see what class names you have there, use them do add some styling... 
> Side Note: when you declare a css class in `jsx`, you need to use `className` keyword instead ðŸ˜‰

## Reading!!

To prepare for tomorrow's lecture, read the following:
- [Conditional Rendering](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/conditional-rendering.html)
- [Lists & Keys](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/lists-and-keys.html)
- [Forms](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/forms.html)
- [Lifting State Up](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/lifting-state-up.html)

## ðŸš€ Deliverables:

You removed `<div class="flex-container">` with its contents in `index.html` and replaced with components rendered by React receiving exactly the same result.
