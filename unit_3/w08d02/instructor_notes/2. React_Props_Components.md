# React (Components & Props) !!!

Objectives: 
* Analyze React apps and begin to think about how to design and build using components
* Understand how to pass and read properties (props) to and from components 
* Compare React Components and Props to JavaScript functions

## What are React Components?

In react, components let you split the User Interface into independent, reusable pieces and think about each piece in isolation.

## Thinking in Components

![React-Components](thinking-in-react-components.png)

How many different components do we see?

1. FilterableProductTable (orange): contains the entirety of the example
2. SearchBar (blue): receives all user input
3. ProductTable (green): displays and filters the data collection based on user input
4. ProductCategoryRow (turquoise): displays a heading for each category
5. ProductRow (red): displays a row for each product

Notice that some sections are being reused.

With React we can design, build, and test a component once, and then we can easily reuse it as needed in our application.

**Let's take a look at the application we are going to build later** 

## Creating our first React component!!

Components in React JS **start with a capital letter**
So we can easily differentiate our components from built in components like h1, div, span and etc.

```JavaScript 
import React, {Component} from 'react';

class MyComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    return(
      <div>
        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default MyComponent
```

```JavaScript 
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return(
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    </div>
  )
}

export default MyComponent
```

**Inside our component we start by returning some dom elements**

**Inside our return statement, we need to wrap our component in tags. (Usually div tags)**


## Using a Component

To use our newly created component. We just do:
`<MyComponent />`
Similar to using any other HTML element

## React Properties (Props)

In React we use properties to customize our components.

There are 2 parts to Props:
1. We create a JSX element with an attribute syntax:

`<MyComponent name='Zachary' />`

2. Then our Component needs to be able to take in that information:

```JavaScript 
import React, {Component} from 'react';

class MyComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    return(
      <div>
        <h1>{this.props.name}</h1>
      </div>
    )
  }
}


export default MyComponent
```

or

```JavaScript
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = (props) => {
  return(
    <div>
      <h1>{props.name}</h1>
    </div>
  )
}


export default MyComponent
```


**Props are immutable (We don't change them) & they don't go in reverse**

Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called "props") and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.

In reference to our above example, we created a function (component) called MyComponent, which takes an argument called props. Then we call it with `<MyComponent name='Zachary' />` Which passes an object that looks like: `{name: 'Zachary'}`
