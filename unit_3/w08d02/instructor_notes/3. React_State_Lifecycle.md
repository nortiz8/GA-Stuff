## [React State](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)

- What are props again? Props can be thought of as properties that one component passes to one of its child components. They only go in one direction, and they are immutable.
- **State** allows us to add dynamic content to our components. Components can have local state that we can **set**. Every time a component's state is set the component will re-render. This is where the magic of React comes into focus. We just `setState` here and there and React/JSX takes care of all the DOM manipulation for us.
- There is one way to set state, using the component's `setState` method. **Note: never do something like:**
```javascript
this.state.title = "find nemo"
```
**Rather, always use the `setState` method.**
- There are two ways to `setState`. We can pass it an object, like so:
```javascript
this.setState({title: "Find Nemo"});
```
or we  can pass it a function, like so:
```javascript
this.setState((prevState, props) => ({
  title: "Find Nemo"
}));
```

The reason you would want to use a function instead of an object is if you want to refer to the component's **current state** in setting its new state.

Each component can have its own local state. We initialize that state in the component's constructor function:

```javascript
class MovieDiv extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      title: ''
    };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>The title is {this.state.title}.</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

React begins to get really powerful when we pass one component's state to one of its child components as a prop. What? Check it out:

```javascript
class 
extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      title: ''
    };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <TitleHeader title={this.state.title} />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

### Mini Lab!

1. Write a small component called `TitleHeader` that displays the title prop in an `<h2>` element.

## [React Component Lifecycle](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)

```javascript
class ToDo extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      title: '',
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    console.log('the component mounted!');
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>The title is {this.state.title}.</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

**NOTE: the constructor should appear up top, followed by lifecycle methods, then your own methods, then the render method. This is a best practice.**

## Fetching data in a React component

If you need to fetch data when your component loads, do it in the `componentDidMount` lifecycle method. I'll say it again: **if you need to fetch data when your component loads, do it in the `componentDidMount` lifecycle method.**

It looks like this:

```javascript
class ToDo extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      title: ''
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    fetch('someUrl')
      .then((response) => {
        return response.json();
      })
      .then((jsonRes) => {
        this.setState({
          title: jsonRes.data.title
        });
      })
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>The title is {this.state.title}.</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

## Fetching data with Axios

`Axios` is a dependency which makes it a bit easier to make api calls. In order for us to use `axios` we need to install it and import it:

1. In your terminal inside of your react app:
`npm i axios`

1. Now at the top of your component `import axios from 'axios'`

Now instead of using fetch we can make an axios call like so:

```javascript
axios(url)
.then(response => {
    const data = response.data;
    this.setState({
        title: data.title
    })
})
```

As you can see this cuts down the amount of code written by almost half. This is because axios automatically converts your response to json.

We can make this even cleaner by using `async/await`

## Fetching data with Axios using async/await

There’s a special syntax called “async/await” that makes it easier to work with promises.

```javascript
async componentDidMount() {
  const response = await axios(url);
  const data = response.data;
  this.setState({
      title: data.title
  })
}
```

The word `async` before the function means the function will return a promise

The word `await` lets your function know that you want the current line to finish executing BEFORE the rest of your code continues to execute.


## [React Events](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/handling-events.html)

Take a look at the docs to see a list of all of the events React has access to. You basically have access to all of the same events that the browser DOM gives you. Under the hood, React is taking care of all the `addEventListener()` stuff.

```javascript
class ToDo extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      title: '',
      releaseDate: ''
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    fetch('someUrl')
      .then((response) => {
        return response.json();
      })
      .then((jsonRes) => {
        this.setState({
          title: jsonRes.data.title
        });
      })
  }

  changeTitle() {
    this.setState({title: "Find Nemo"});
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>The title is {this.state.title}.</h2>
        <button onClick={this.changeTitle}>Change button title</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```
