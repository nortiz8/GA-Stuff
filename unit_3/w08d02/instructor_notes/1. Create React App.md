 - Learn how to build an app with Create React App


## It's 2019 Y'all

If you've googled anything about what to learn to be a web developer, you've likely been overwhelmingly crushed by the number of tools, technologies and buckets full of acronym soup.

All of these tools are meant to solve problems. But with too many tools it can be a problem in and of itself. Which one(s) do you learn? Additionally, as new web devs a lot of the tools can seem like total magic and it can be really hard to to figure out what is what and it can even impede learning when you take on too much too fast. Especially when the documentation is not very good.

So we've been really selective about which tools we teach. Thinking about what be will serve you post-course.

**Create React App** is built by facebook and it is meant for:
- Learning React in a comfortable and feature-rich development environment (good errors! warnings, notes about best practices, hot reloading, zero configuration)
- Starting new single page applications
- Creating Examples with react for  your libraries and components

Create React App isn't the best choice for:
- a sandbox where you just want to try some samples out (try a simple html page)
- A mostly static site (portfolio, blog)
- Server side rendering

## Let's get started
- In your terminal `npm i -g npx`
- Navigate to `student_examples`
- `npx create-react-app practice_app`
- `cd practice_app`
- `rm -rf .git` - because we are in the class repository - no git reps inside other git repos!
- open a new tab in terminal
- `npm start`
- in the other open tab `code .`

Let's look at our folders

The `public` folder holds static assets like the favicon and the `index.html` that will load in the browser

The `src` folder has a lot new things

- `App.css` - a different way to organize and use CSS than what we are used to. [As a bonus you can learn this way](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-a-stylesheet) or we can just link our CSS like we always have been or you can work in the `index.css` file

- `App.js` the main React component, we'll be writing in here
- `App.test.js` - we haven't gotten a chance to dive into testing but if you look at the code, in summary it says if the app doesn't crash load it. If the app does crash a lot of things happen but they require some deeper poking aorund
- `index.css` - if you do your css in here, it will be most familiar to what we've already been doing in the course.
- `index.js` - this file has some magic going in in it. Suffice to say, if you create React components in the `src` folder, they will magically work
- `logo.svg`-that's that spinning react logo you see in the browser. SVG is a really great technology worth exploring sometime later...
- `serviceWorker.js`, rather than an express app serving our web pages, this service worker is helping us interact with our app in the browser. [More info](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/) - we are going to go ahead and call this part 'magic' since we don't have time to jump down this rabit hole.

Note: if you need to add a dependency you'd just run `npm install react-router-dom` or any other dependency you might want.
