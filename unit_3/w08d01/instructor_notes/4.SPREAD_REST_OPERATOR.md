# Spread and Destructuring

## Spread Operator with Arrays

The spread operator `...` allows an expression to be expanded into multiple elements.

This is useful for separating an array into individual elements...

```js
const dimensions = [10, 5, 2]
const volume = (height, width, length) => {
  return height * width * length
}

// ES5
volume(dimensions[0], dimensions[1], dimensions[2])

// ES6
volume(...dimensions)
```

## Spread Operator with Objects


## Avoiding Mutation

You can use the spread operator to combine new arrays without mutating them by combining the spread operator with an existing array

```js
const arr1 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']

const arr2 = [...arr1, 'e', 'f', 'g']
console.log(arr2) // ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g']
```

You can also create a new array with by using the spread operator with two arrays

```js
const arr2 = [ 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g' ]
const arr3 = [ 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k' ]

const arr4 = [ ...arr2, ...arr3 ]
console.log(arr4) // ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k']
```

This also works with objects

```js
const obj1 = { a: 1, b: 2 }
const obj2 = { c: 3, d: 4 }

const obj3 = { ...obj1, ...obj2 }
console.log(obj3) // { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 }
```

This also makes it very easy to create copies of an array in functions where
mutation occurs. Here is some code in which we generate a reversed array of days (`reversedDays`) from a sorted array of days (`days`). This approach ends up mutating the original `days` array.

```js
const days = ["monday","tuesday","wednesday","thursday","friday","saturday","sunday"]
const reversedDays = (arr) => {
  return arr.reverse()
}
console.log(reversedDays(days))
// => Returns the reversed array of days.

console.log(days)
// => But now `days` is reversed as well.
```

We can use the spread operator to avoid this effect. Below you'll find two examples: one that does not use the spread operator and one that does.

```js
// ES5
const reversedDays = (arr) => {
  const newArray = []
  for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
    newArray.push(arr[i])
  }
  return newArray.reverse()
}
console.log(reversedDays(days))
console.log(days)

// ES6
const reversedDays = (arr) => {
  return [...arr].reverse()
}
console.log(reversedDays(days))
console.log(days)
```

## Destructuring

Destructuring makes it possible to extract data from collections (i.e., arrays and objects) into distinct constiables.

### Destructuring Arrays

Let's say we want to pull some values out of an array and save them in constiables. With what we know so far, we would do something like this...

```js
// ES5

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]

const first = numbers[0]
const second = numbers[1]
const third = numbers[2]
const fourth = numbers[3]
```

With ES6, we can now destructure arrays and assign those constiables like the below example. This can be very useful when you need to assign multiple constiables at the same time.

```js
// ES6

const [first, second, third, fourth] = [1, 2, 3, 4]

console.log(first)
// => 1

console.log(second)
// => 2
```

We could also use this approach...

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
const [first, second, third] = numbers

console.log(first)
// => 1

console.log(second)
// => 2

console.log(third)
// => 3
```

> Array destructuring knows to begin assigning values from left to right. If we had also included a `fourth` constiable inside of the array destructuring in the above example, it would have set it to 4.

### Destructuring Objects

We can do something similar with objects. Let's say we have the following object, which represents a user...

```js
const bob = {
   id: 1,
   name: "Bob",
   age: 43 ,
   profileUrl: "http://api.co/users/1",
   location: "DC"
}
```

If we want to quickly extract some values from that object -- let's say `name` and `age` -- we can do the following...

```js
const { name, age } = bob

console.log(name)
// => "Bob"

console.log(age)
// => 43
```

We can do something similar with objects when passing them as arguments into a function...

```js
const bob = {
   id: 1,
   name: "Bob",
   age: 43 ,
   profileUrl: "http://api.co/users/1",
   location: "DC"
}

// ES5
const greetUser = (user) => {
  console.log("Hello " + user.name + ", how's the weather in " + user.location)
}

greetUser(bob)

// ES6
const greetUser = ({ name, location }) => {
  console.log("Hello " + name + ", how's the weather in " + location)
}

greetUser(bob)
```
