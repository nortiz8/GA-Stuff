# Introduction to ReactJS

## Objectives

1. Define declarative and imperative programming
2. Describe single page applications
3. Explain some common React terminology
4. Recognize the motivations for React

## Declarative vs Imperative programming

- Imperative: The focus is on what steps the computer should take rather than what the computer will do (ex. C, C++, Java).

- Declarative: The focus is on what the computer should do rather than how it should do it (ex. SQL).

- imperative and declarative describe two opposing styles of programming. imperative is the traditional "step by step recipe" approach while declarative is more "this is what i want, now you work out how to do it".

## Single Page Apps (SPAs)

- "A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or web site that fits on a single web page with the goal of providing a user experience similar to that of a desktop application. In an SPA, either all necessary code – HTML, JavaScript, and CSS – is retrieved with a single page load, or the appropriate resources are dynamically loaded and added to the page as necessary, usually in response to user actions. The page does not reload at any point in the process, nor does control transfer to another page, although the location hash or the HTML5 History API can be used to provide the perception and navigability of separate logical pages in the application. Interaction with the single page application often involves dynamic communication with the web server behind the scenes." - [wikipedia!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)

## The need for libraries/frameworks

- As your web app grows the need for strict code organization grows with it. Otherwise, you end up with spaghetti code!

## React - a user interface library

- At the core of React are Components, which you can think of as pieces of an user interface. There are lots of moving parts to components but they all have at least a render method that returns a React element.
- React elements are immutable JavaScript objects. React utilizes its "Virtual DOM" to update the browser DOM much faster than normal.
- React is a JavaScript library used to craft modern UI's for front end in web client and native applications (native = mobile / desktop)
  * Note: React is a LIBRARY and not a FRAMEWORK - It does not dictate _how_ you do things
- First used by Facebook in 2011 and Instagram in 2012. Was finally offered as open source in May of 2013.
- Was originally conceived out of Facebook's need for a solution to ease the process of continuously re-rendering parts of views
- React can be thought of as the view layer

## The ubiquity of React

- Everybody uses React... it's being adopted by many companies including Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, Netflix, Walmart, etc. Even other frameworks are incorporating many of its concepts and ideas.
- It can be used everywhere. React Native allows you to transfer your web dev skills to Android and iOS app development.
- Developer happiness
  * Descriptive warnings and errors
  * Great Documentation
- Everyone is loving it right now so there is a _huge_ community. Even the big names are in on the love: Facebook (obviously), Netflix, Reddit, Twitter, Walmart, etc.
  * Even other new frameworks are starting to incorporate the concepts and ideas React is introducing
- It can be used anywhere
  * web & native
- Virtual DOM

## Thinking in React - Components

- The first step to thinking in React is to see websites as collections of components. One simple example is a blog. A blog might have a PostList component, a Post component, a CommentList component, a Comment component, and on.
- Each of these components are reusable, composable, and efficient. As we'll see as we move deeper into React, building user interfaces in this manner makes data fetching, handling, and mutating more straightforward.

## Virtual DOM

### First What is the DOM?
- Document Object Model - it's a way of representing our structured HTML document with objects.
- Web browsers handle DOM manipulation details, so we use JavaScript and CSS to interact with it

### What's the problem with it?
- The main problem with the DOM is that is was never optimized for handling and creating dynaamic User Interfaces.
- We have libraries like jQuery that can manipulate the DOM, but it never addresses performance issues.
- For sites like Facebook where you scroll through your timeline, over time user's would have thousands of DOM nodes, and interacting with them could end up being extremely expensive.

### So what is the Virtual DOM?
- The Virtual DOM is an abstract version of the DOM.
- Think of it as a lightweight copy of our DOM.
- We can change it as we want and then save those changes to our real DOM tree. While saving, find differences and only rerender the things we need changed.
- By only making necessary changes as opposed to re-rendering the entire view altogether, we save processing power

## Components
- Visit `Reddit.com` and take a moment to break the site down to it's most basic components.
  * Think about what parts are reusable on the site
- Before we start getting into React we need to start thinking in components!

## React Hello World
- Create a project with CRA called `react-hello-world`
- Go through the architecture of a React application.
