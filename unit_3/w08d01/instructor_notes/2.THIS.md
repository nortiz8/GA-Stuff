# It All Comes Down to THIS

### Objectives

* Review OOP
* Review how `this` keyword is used
* Use `bind`ing to preserve context

## Binding

### OOP Review

```js
class Hero {
  constructor() {
    this.name = 'Superman'
    this.secretIdentity = 'Clark Kent'
    this.city='Metropolis'
  }

  catchphrase() {
    console.log('Up up and away!')
  }
}

const superman = new Hero()
superman.name // Superman
superman.secretIdentity // Clark Kent
superman.catchphrase() // Up up and away!
```

### Using `this`

```js
class Hero {
  constructor() {
    this.name = 'Superman'
    this.secretIdentity = 'Clark Kent'
    this.city = 'Metropolis'
  }

  catchphrase() {
    console.log('Up up and away!')
  }

  greeting() {
    console.log(`Hello, I'm ${this.name} from ${this.city}`)
  }
}

const superman = new Hero()
superman.name // Superman
superman.secretIdentity // Clark Kent
superman.catchphrase() // Up up and away!
superman.greeting() // Hello, I'm Superman from Metropolis
```

`superman.catchphrase` is a function just like any other. I can do anything with it - even store it in a variable!

```js
...

const superman = new Hero()
superman.name // Superman
superman.secretIdentity // Clark Kent
superman.catchphrase() // Up up and away!
superman.greeting // Hello, I'm Superman from Metropolis

const supermansCatchprase = superman.catchphrase
supermansCatchprase() // Up up and away!
```

Let's try the same with `superman.greeting`. What do we get?

```js
...

const superman = new Hero()
superman.name // Superman
superman.secretIdentity // Clark Kent
superman.catchphrase() // Up up and away!
superman.greeting // Hello, I'm Superman from Metropolis

const supermansGreeting = superman.greeting
supermansGreeting() // TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined
```

Why do you think we're getting this error?

The answer gets very technical but to try and put it in its simplest terms by storing the `superman.greeting` method into a variable and using it, it loses track of where it's being called. (Do you remember all that talk of scope back in Unit 1?). There's a very simple fix to this and it's done by adding one line to our code

```js
class Hero {
  constructor() {
    this.name = 'Superman'
    this.secretIdentity = 'Clark Kent'
    this.city = 'Metropolis'

    this.greeting = this.greeting.bind(this)
  }

  catchphrase() {
    console.log('Up up and away!')
  }

  greeting() {
    console.log(`Hello, I'm ${this.name} from ${this.city}`)
  }
}

const superman = new Hero()
superman.name // Superman
superman.secretIdentity // Clark Kent
superman.catchphrase() // Up up and away!
superman.greeting() // Hello, I'm Superman from Metropolis

const supermansCatchphrase = superman.catchprase
supermansCatchphrase() // Up up and away!

const supermansGreeting = superman.greeting
supermansGreeting() // Hello, I'm Superman from Metropolis
```

By adding `this.greeting = this.greeting.bind(this)`, our method can keep track of itself as it gets moved around

Why did we not need to bind this for our `supermansCatchprase` function? Because the original `catchprase` method doesn't reference `this` in anyway, it doesn't care where it's being used. Long story short, you only need to bind if your method uses `this`
