# React Lifting Up State

## Learning Objectives
 - Learn how to lift state up from a component

React's data flow is unidirectional and data flows down: Data moves from parent components down. A parent component has no idea about the state of its child components.

Let's say we have 3 components:
- App
  - MyProducts
  - ShoppingCart


We want to add products to our shopping cart by clicking on the item.

How would we have to setup our app to achieve this. We've seen that we pass state down from parent to child in React but in this case we would need to pass our products information from `MyProducts` to `ShoppingCart`. These don't have a parent/child relationship - instead they have a sibling relationship

There is no way to move data from one sibling to another. We will have to lift state up out of `MyProducts` into the `App` component and then pass it down to `ShoppingCart`.

**App.js**

```js
this.state = {
  products: products,
  cart: []
}
```

We're getting those initial products from our `products.js` file. To render those products in the products component, let's pass those products in our state down to our `MyProducts` component.

**App.js**
```js
<MyProducts products={this.state.products} />
```

Now, that we've passed the products to `MyProducts` we can access that information from our props and render them on the page. How do you think we could do that? Remember, React can only render *expressions* **not** *statements*

We need to loop over the data! The same way that in Express we needed to loop over our data to render it onto the page, here we need to loop over our data to render it on the page. The only difference is that instead of using a `for` loop or a `forEach`, we need to use a `map` since that is an expression.

We can use the `map` to render a div that renders the data for each product object.

```js
class MyProducts extends Component {
    render() {
        return(
            <div className='product'>
                My Products
                {
                    this.props.products.map((product, index) => {
                        return(
                            <div className='product' key={index}>
                                <h1>{product.name}</h1>
                                <p>{product.price}</p>
                                <p>{product.description}</p>
                            </div>
                        )
                    })
                }
            </div>
        )
    }
}
```

Now, let's create a function that lets us add things to our cart. We'll pass it down to our `MyProducts` component as a prop so that we can add products from there. Let's add a check just so that we know things are synced correctly

**App.js**
```js
addToCart() {
  console.log('addToCart running')
}

...

<MyProducts products={this.state.products} addToCart={this.addToCart} />
```

Since we want our `addToCart` method to run when we click a product, let's add an `onClick` event to our div that represents our product

**MyProducts.js**
```js
<div onClick={this.props.addToCart} className='product'>
  <h1>{product.name}</h1>
  <p>{product.price}</p>
  <p>{product.description}</p>
</div>
```

Now if we click on any of our products divs, they console.log a message when they are clicked. 

Let's update our addToCart function - remember, the end goal is for it take in a product and add that product to the cart.

```js
addToCart(product) {
  console.log(product)
  this.setState({ 
    cart: [ item, ...this.state.cart ]
  })
  console.log(this.state.cart)
}
```

We also need to pass in an argument to this function when we call it. We can't have `onClick={this.props.addToCart(product)}` or else the function would fire on page load.

We have to wrap it in an anonymous function in order to be able to pass it an argument.

**MyProducts.js**
```js
<div onClick={() => this.props.addToCart(product)} className='product'>
  <h1>{product.name}</h1>
  <p>{product.price}</p>
  <p>{product.description}</p>
</div>
```

If you try, running it now you'll get the error, `TypeError: Cannot read property 'cart' of undefined`. Don't forget to bind it!

```js
constructor (props) {
  super(props)
  this.state = {
    products: products,
    cart: []
  }
  this.addToCart = this.addToCart.bind(this)
}
```



When we click we should see a log of the item and the cart

**GOTCHA**

![](https://i.imgur.com/JBcuwp0.png)

Javascript is asynchronous. So you'll see that we clicked the allen wrench and then console logged the cart array but it is empty!

Then when we click the next item, the array has one item!

This is because it takes longer for things to update with `setState` than to fire off the console.log. We *can* use a callback in set state to have more control of the order of events. But for now, let's wrap up our app by rendering the items in the cart array on the page. This will be almost identical to how we rendered in our `MyProducts` component aside from different names

**App.js**

```js
<ShoppingCart cart={this.state.cart}/>
```

Let's render our cart list

**ShoppingCart.js**

```js
<div className='shopping-cart'>
    Shopping Cart
    {
        this.props.cart.map((cartItem, index) => {
            return (
                <div key={index} className='cart-item'>
                    <h1>{cartItem.name}</h1>
                    <p>{cartItem.price}</p>
                    <p>{cartItem.description}</p>
                </div>
            )
        })
    }
</div>
```

Your finished app should look like this

**App.js**
```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import './App.css';
import MyProducts from './components/MyProducts';
import ShoppingCart from './components/ShoppingCart';
import products from './products';

class App extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super()
    this.state = {
      products: products,
      cart: []
    }

    this.addToCart = this.addToCart.bind(this)
  }
  
  addToCart(product) {
    this.setState({
      cart: [ product, ...this.state.cart ]
    })
  }

  render() {
    return(
      <div className='App'>
        App
        <main>
          <MyProducts products={this.state.products} addToCart={this.addToCart} />
          <ShoppingCart cart={this.state.cart} />
        </main>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default App;
```

**MyProducts**
```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class MyProducts extends Component {
    render() {
        return(
            <div className='my-products'>
                My Products
                {
                    this.props.products.map((product) => {
                        return(
                            <div onClick={() => this.props.addToCart(product)} className='product'>
                                <h1>{product.name}</h1>
                                <p>{product.price}</p>
                                <p>{product.description}</p>
                            </div>
                        )
                    })
                }
            </div>
        )
    }
}

export default MyProducts
```

**ShoppingCart.js**
```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class ShoppingCart extends Component {
    render() {
        return(
            <div className='shopping-cart'>
                Shopping Cart
                {
                    this.props.cart.map((cartItem) => {
                        return (
                            <div className='cart-item'>
                                <h1>{cartItem.name}</h1>
                                <p>{cartItem.price}</p>
                                <p>{cartItem.description}</p>
                            </div>
                        )
                    })
                }
            </div>
        )
    }
}

export default ShoppingCart
```


### Challenge

When you add an item, it adds to the list, if you add multiples of the same item, it just adds to the array. Upgrade this app so that when you have one item it adds to the list. But if you add the same item to your ShoppingCart it will just stay as one item and show a count total
