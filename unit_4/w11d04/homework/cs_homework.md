# The Final CS Homework!

## Learning Objectives
 - Explain what is a search algorithm
 - Explain what a binary tree is
 - Explain what makes a binary search so great
 - Explain what is a data structure
 - Explain what is a linked list
 - Explain the pros and cons of a linked list
 
 
 
 ### Part 1
 
 #### Search
 - Go to [MyGA - Algorithms, Search Algorithms](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/633?from=dashboard&assignmentUuid=ef3ae77a-15d7-4035-b380-c8514d01858c)
    - read, watch and study the 17 slides
    - create a new `markdown` file in this folder and answer
        - What does brute force mean?
        - How is a binary search like a dictionary?
        - What is the time complexity of a binary search?
        - Draw a binary tree using the following numbers (put 50 at the root) - do it on paper and take a photo and upload it or use a drawing program
          - 16, 99, 44, 35, 88, 75, 22, 18, 5, 15, 46, 88, 77, 89
          
 ##### Data Structures
 
 - Go to [MyGA Data Structure](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/878?from=dashboard&assignmentUuid=1942266e-abb0-4379-b988-d91e57f75549)
  - read, watch and study the 9 slides
   - In your own words explain what is (in your markdown file)
     - Linked List
     - Stacks
     - Queues
     - Binary Tree
     
 ##### Data Structures
  - Go to [MyGA Data Structure](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/878?from=dashboard&assignmentUuid=1942266e-abb0-4379-b988-d91e57f75549)
  - read, watch and study the 16 slides
  - In your own words, explain the following (in your markdown file)
 - What is the difference between an array and a linked list
 - What is one advantage of a linked list?
 - What is one disadvantage?
 - Give one use of a linked list
 
 #### Hungry for More
 
 - Implement the binary searches on code pen (at the end of the slides)
 - Implement a linked list on code pend (at the end of the slides)
